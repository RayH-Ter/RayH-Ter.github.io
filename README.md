## Create your own homepage based on Github Page and Jekyll

1. Create a new repo named yourGithubName.github.io.
2. Create an index.html and start to edit this file to make you homepage look as pretty as you can.
3. Plenty of ready-made templates are avaviliable on [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/). Just download one you like, and add files you downloaded to the repo you've created, then almost everything is done except filling in your own information and notes you'd like to show on your homepage.
